# ActiveRecord

ActiveRecord is an [Object Relationship
Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
gem loosely based on the [Active
Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Record) design pattern.

You'll be using ActiveRecord throughout your time here; so know it well.

## :+1:
1. I've created migrations and models
1. I've used 
   [sinatra-activrecord](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord) to
   integrate activerecord and sinatra
1. I've defined `belongs_to` and `has_many` relationships
1. I've written tests to verify my relationships work
1. I've written validations for presence and uniqueness
1. I've written tests to verify my validations work
1. I've retrieved validation errors from a models `errors` method
1. I can easily use `where` and `find` to retrieve data

## :+1: :+1:
1. I can use relations to
   [create](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Relation.html#method-i-create)
   elements within a set as well as form the basis for other interactions with the
   [query interface](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html)
1. I've written [custom
   validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#performing-custom-validations)
1. I've used
[callbacks](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html)
1. I test drive my models with the
   [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers)

## :+1: :+1: :+1:
1. I use
[scopes](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#scopes) to
keep `where`'s out of my code.
1. I have used another ORM (i.e. datamapper or sequel)
1. I've written a simple ORM from scratch
