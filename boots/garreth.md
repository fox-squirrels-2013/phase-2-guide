 Today I got a better grasp on objects and classes in Javascript. I also solidified my
 understanding of  many to many tables in Active Record

November 12th:
I've become much more comfortable with Javascript callback functions and Object Oriented Design. Im experimenting with design patterns such as the mediator and observer. Ive also focused on writing almost exclusively in Javascript to understand the fundamentals instead of using Jquery for shortcuts.
