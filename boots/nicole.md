Sorry, the fractions may be a little off. Few changes from yesterday, but I have managed to write my own Rspec tests, which is tons of fun. Note that I actually know a bit of HTML and CSS, which is why it's as high as this. I'll still need to work on some stuff, and also work on my group dynamic.

Today, I learned quite a bit more about sessions. I had looked into them last night, but they're incredibly simple. I was also better able to write custom error messages, though I can't seem to implement them well quite yet. However, I found that my emotional mindset is off, considering I was extremely
offended when the strongest members of our groups broke off. My group thought it was a trick question, so we hadn't 
seriously debated it.

Today was odd. First, my pair and I did the HTML/CSS challenge, which wasn't all that difficult, though I was surprised my
pair didn't know as much as I thought. However, he caught on really quickly, though I had to pause to explain things like
the box model, as well as some of the CSS3 tricks. I did learn quite a bit more about animations, though, and managed to
make a seizure-inducing web page. My pair even found a neat JavaScript trick, because he wanted the animations to loop
over and over again. I also found that I really suck at making my own responsive two-column layout, though we were able
to make an odd Frankenstein responsive/fixed hybrid that broke down on anything that wasn't the DBC monitors. 
In the afternoon, we found how to use BCrypt (I apparently wasn't including the file in my test code, which made me think 
that I sucked at it), and also discovered the joys of merging two files at the same time. (Just FYI, never do that, 
especially if the project is due in 5 minutes.) Now, though, we have a neat page.

Today felt like a review day. I already did the portfolio challenges (for the most part - one actually requires some Javascript
to work, so I didn't do it) and the Javascript stuff, so I could devote most of my day to tweaking a few of the challenges 
and really drill down on Craigslist, Jr.

One cool thing I found while doing CL, Jr. was the use of Digest. Ben next to me alerted to its presence, but I found 
that it combined with the gem FriendlyId allowed me to connect the hashes created by Digest to the database, thus 
linking each hash to the code itself. The gem also allows me to look up a hash based on the title of the post.

I felt I could have made more progress today. It felt like we were fumbling around all morning, trying to figure out 
objects. However, Myles really illuminated quite a few things about it. Probably the best thing I took from it is the 
quirks of Javascript syntax. Also, I have a greater understanding of what Javascript can access, and am better prepared 
to select a sepecific object for the job (e.g., document when elements in the HTML need to be manipulated).

Today was frustrating. It was less the code (though I really should remember more Javascript than the nil I seem to have 
retained from college) and more the fact that my ankle on my bad leg swelled up to twice its size. However, despite that,
I managed to finish 2/3 of the testing challenge from this morning (late), and managed to write functional code with 
Marion during the group project. I also have a better idea of Javascript objects, and know fairly well how testing with 
Jasmine works.
