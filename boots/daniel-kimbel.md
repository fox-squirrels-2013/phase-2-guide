Today, I solidified some of my learning on Sinatra and ActiveRecord. I learned how to access error messages (including the full versions) from ActiveModel, and learned how to set custom error messages. I also brushed up on CSS, and am going to spend more of this evening studying Javascript.

Today, I learned a decent bit of CSS. I also learned about buttons vs. forms in Sinatra, and when to use each (buttons are really all about Javascript with their onclick actions). I also learned a bit more about partials.

I learned some awesome Sinatra tricks today -- how to use a form to send a delete request, and (more importantly) how to use layout.erb to get global headers and footers onto your web app.

I learned a decent amount about using Sinatra today, and got the opportunity to learn more about RSpec. I still feel extremely weak in the latter, though.
